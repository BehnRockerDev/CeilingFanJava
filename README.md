# CeilingFanJava Java Console App

## Description

To run, simply compile and run like any other Java project, either via command line or IDE. In case you'd like to skip the build, there is a `.jar` file included in the repo (`CeilingFan.jar`, directly in the root of the repo).

All code is written in Java. This is a fairly simplistic app, which will allow you to change the speed and direction of a ceiling fan.
